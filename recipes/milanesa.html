    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place each chicken breast between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them with a meat mallet or the flat
            side of a heavy pan until they are about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with a
            mixture of breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
        <li>Dip the floured chicken breasts into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off.</li>
        <li>Coat the chicken breasts evenly in the breadcrumb and Parmesan mixture, pressing gently to adhere.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Carefully add the breaded chicken breasts to the hot oil and fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, until golden
            brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Transfer the fried chicken breasts to a plate lined with paper towels to drain off any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
